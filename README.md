# Fleet Management HTTP API Client

This is a Client for the Fleet Management HTTP API. You can find the Fleet Management HTTP API repository [here](https://github.com/bringauto/fleet-management-http-api).
The HTTP API is described by the `openapi/openapi.yaml` according to [OpenAPI Specification](https://openapis.org).
A full specification can be found in the `openapi` folder in the root folder.

## Auto-generated code
The auto-generated code can be found in the `fleet_management_http_client_python` folder.
The code is generated using the `openapi-generator-cli` tool. The code is generated using the `openapi/openapi.yaml` file.
DO NOT edit the auto-generated code manually.

## Documentation
The auto-generated documentation for the client models and API is in the `fleet_http_client_python/docs` folder.

# Usage
To use the client, get the code from the repository or install it according to the instructions below. You can look at the `example/client_impl.py` file for an example of how to use the client.

## Installation
To install the client, run
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bringauto/fleet-management-http-client-python.git
```

## Client re-generation
If you want to re-generate the client code with the new specification, you first have to replace the specification in the `openapi` folder.
Then you can run the `regen.sh` script (from the root folder). [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), git and [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation) are required.

# Requirements
Python 3.10.12+
